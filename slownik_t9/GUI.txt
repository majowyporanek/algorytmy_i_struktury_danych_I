Choose a GUI library or framework that you are comfortable with, such as Qt, wxWidgets, FLTK or imgui.

Design the layout of the phone overlay GUI. This could include elements such as a background image of a phone, buttons for the number keys, a text input for displaying the number being dialed, and a button for dialing the number.

Create the GUI elements using the library or framework you have chosen. For example, you can create buttons for the number keys using the "Button" widget, and a text input for displaying the number being dialed using the "TextInput" widget.

Create the callback functions for the buttons. For example, when the number keys are pressed, the corresponding number should be displayed in the text input. When the "Dial" button is pressed, the number displayed in the text input should be dialed.

Create the event handling functions to handle the button presses.

Add the image of phone background to the gui.

Test the implementation by running it and ensure that it behaves as expected.
