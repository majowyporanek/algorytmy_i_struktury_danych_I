Create a trie data structure to store the words in the dictionary. Each node in the trie represents a letter, and the edges between nodes represent the letters that make up a word.

Create a hash table to store the mappings of digits to letters, based on the T9 keypad layout. For example, the digit "2" could be mapped to the letters "a", "b", and "c".

Populate the trie with the words in the dictionary. This can be done by reading the words from a file, or by manually adding them to the trie.

Create a function to search the trie for words that match the digits entered by the user. This function should take the digits entered as input and use the hash table to convert them to the corresponding letters. It should then use a prefix search algorithm to find words in the trie that match the sequence of letters.

When a user enters a digit, you can use the hash table to find the corresponding letters, then use these letters to search the trie for matching words.

Create a way to handle ambiguous input, such as when multiple words match the same sequence of digits. This could involve displaying a list of all the possible words that match the input, or allowing the user to enter more digits to disambiguate the input.

Test the implementation by running it with different inputs and ensuring that it returns the expected results.
